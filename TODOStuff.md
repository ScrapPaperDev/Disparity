- Stuff I would like to do later

- Implement basic serialization system as well as the [Data] attribute.
- serializable objects with converters for each adapter layer plugin, for example as a prefab in unity, or scene in godot.
- editor gui plugin support
- coroutine manager, so our code can just say StartCoroutine(Ienumerator). we dont really want to have to be concerned with which implementation we are using.
- fix vector3 operators
- general settings for common things like delta time or maybe a di framework.
